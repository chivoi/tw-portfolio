It balances ease of use with performance and supports simulations with arbitrary detector geometries deployed in ice or water.\\n\\nPrometheus simulates neutrino interactions in the volume surrounding the detector, computes the light yield of hadronic showers and the outgoing leptons, propagates photons in the medium, and records their arrival times and positions in user-defined regions. Events are then serialized to Parquet files, a compact and interoperable format that enables efficient access for downstream analysis.\\n\\nFor a detailed description of the package, see [arXiv:2304.14526](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.14526).\\n\\n### Authors\\n\\n1. [Jeffrey Lazar](https://inspirehep.net/authors/1771794) \\n2. [Stephan Meighen-Berger](https://inspirehep.net/authors/1828460)\\n3. [Christian Haack](https://inspirehep.net/authors/1284379)\\n4.

[Carlos Arg\xfcelles Delgado](https://inspirehep.net/authors/1074902)\\n\\n### Terms of Use\\n\\nPrometheus is open-source. You are free to copy, modify, and distribute it with attribution under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public License. See the LICENSE file for details.\\n\\n## Getting Started\\n\\nTo work with Prometheus, you will need:\\n\\n- [Python](https://realpython.com/installing-python/) 3.11 or higher\\n- [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/) for Python package management. It usually comes with installing Python, so you should already have it.\\n\\nAdditional prerequisites depend on your installation method and are detailed in the [Installation](#installation) section below.\\n\\n## Installation\\n\\nThere are two options to install Prometheus:\\n\\n- Download and compile dependencies from source/`PyPI`\\n- Use provided Docker or Singularity containers with prebuilt dependencies\\n\\n### Install from Source\\n\\nIf you have Python and pip installed, this would be the most straightforward installation method.\\n\\nTo start, clone this repository onto your machine:\\n\\n```sh\\ngit clone git@github.com:Harvard-Neutrino/prometheus.git\\n```\\n\\n#### Prerequisites\\n\\nTo work with Prometheus, you need to install the following packages:\\n\\n1. **[LeptonInjector](https://github.com/icecube/LeptonInjector)** - Required for selecting neutrino interaction quantities. Installation instructions are available in the [project repository](https://github.com/icecube/LeptonInjector?tab=readme-ov-file#download-compilation-and-installation).\\n\\n2. **[PROPOSAL](https://github.com/tudo-astroparticlephysics/PROPOSAL)** - Used to propagate charged leptons resulting from neutrino interactions. PROPOSAL installation is included in the Prometheus setup script, but some users reported issues on certain operating systems. If needed, you can install it separately, following its [installation guide](https://github.com/tudo-astroparticlephysics/PROPOSAL/blob/master/INSTALL.md).\\n\\n3. **[Photon Propagation Code (PPC)](https://github.com/Harvard-Neutrino/prometheus/tree/main/resources/PPC_executables)** - Required for ice-based detector simulations. Two versions are available:\\n    - CPU version ([compilation instructions](https://github.com/Harvard-Neutrino/prometheus/tree/main/resources/PPC_executables/PPC))\\n    - GPU/CUDA version ([compilation instructions](https://github.com/Harvard-Neutrino/prometheus/tree/main/resources/PPC_executables/PPC_CUDA)).\\n\\n    Both of these use a modified version of the official [PPC code](https://github.com/icecube/ppc).\\n\\n4. **[LeptonWeighter](https://github.com/icecube/LeptonWeighter)** (optional) - Required for event weighting. Installation instructions are available in the [project repository](https://github.com/icecube/LeptonWeighter?tab=readme-ov-file#installation).\\n\\n#### Compilation\\n\\nAfter installing the prerequisites, run the setup script from the Prometheus base directory:\\n\\n```sh\\npython3 python -m pip setup.py install\\n```\\n\\nThis will install all remaining dependencies needed to run simulations.\\n\\n:::tip\\nIf you encounter issues installing PROPOSAL through the setup script, install it separately before running the script. See PROPOSAL\'s [advanced installation guide](https://github.com/tudo-astroparticlephysics/PROPOSAL/blob/master/INSTALL.md) for instructions.\\n:::\\n\\n### Install with Containers\\n\\nIf you need to run simulations on a computing cluster or the source installation doesn\'t work for you, Docker and Singularity images with all dependencies prebuilt are available in [this public Google drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-PbSiZQr0n85g9PrhbHMeURDOA02QUSY?usp=sharing).\\n\\n:::warning \\nThe Docker and Singularity images we provide are not currently compatible with ARM-based system architectures, which causes issues when running them on computers with Mac M-series chips. If you are a Mac user, consider [installing Prometheus from source](#install-from-source).\\n:::\\n\\n#### Using Docker\\n\\nIf you need help getting started with Docker, see the [Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/). Here is the outline of the steps you need to take to set things up:\\n\\n**1. Load the image**\\n\\nDownload the latest version `.tar.gz` file from the [Google Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Ok0czMhOd8S0N73oyPn5B2mFWp_D5gUx), navigate to the directory where you downloaded the file, and run:\\n\\n```sh\\ndocker load < prometheus_v_<VERSION>.tar.gz\\n```\\n\\nReplace `<VERSION>` with the actual version number (e.g., `1_0_2`). This will load the image into Docker. To learn more about loading images and available options, refer to the [Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/reference/cli/docker/image/load/).\\n\\n**2. Run the container and launch a shell**\\n\\n```sh\\ndocker run -it prometheus_v_<VERSION>:latest sh\\n```\\n\\nFor more container running options, refer to the [Docker containers documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/containers/run/).\\n\\n#### GPU Support with Docker\\n\\nFor GPU-accelerated simulations, you will need to build a custom Docker image from the GPU Dockerfile [provided in the repository](https://github.com/Harvard-Neutrino/prometheus/tree/main/container). After building and starting the image, compile PPC with GPU support by running `make gpu` in the [PPC_CUDA](https://github.com/Harvard-Neutrino/prometheus/tree/main/resources/PPC_executables/PPC_CUDA) directory within the container.\\n\\n:::info\\nYou may need to modify the architecture version in the PPC makefile to match your GPU hardware.\\n:::\\n\\n#### Using Singularity\\n\\nIf you need help getting started with Singularity, see the [Singularity documentation](https://docs.sylabs.io/guides/3.5/user-guide/introduction.html).\\n\\nSingularity is particularly useful for running simulations on computing clusters. To use the Singularity container:\\n\\n**1. Clone this repository**\\n\\nThe Singularity setup is still under construction, and there may be issues running software using only the files in the container. To avoid these issues, clone the repository onto your machine and navigate into the project directory:\\n\\n```sh\\ngit clone git@github.com:Harvard-Neutrino/prometheus.git && cd ./prometheus\\n```\\n\\n**2. Download the container image**\\n\\nDownload the latest version `.sif` file (currently v1.0.2) from the [Google Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1oeI4yX_BjdStaDKzx_IsYURxSnuNY3vn)\\n\\n:::info\\nWe use [Boost](https://www.boost.org/) libraries for file structure management. Some systems with older kernels may not be compatible with newer Boost versions. If you encounter compatibility issues, use the `.sif` files with the \\"old\\" keyword: `prometheus_old_<VERSION>.sif`.\\n:::\\n\\n**3. Launch a Singularity shell within the container**\\n\\n```sh\\nsingularity shell <FILENAME>.sif\\n```\\n\\nReplace `<FILENAME>` with the actual name of your downloaded `.sif` file.\\n\\n#### Source the Environment File\\n\\n:::tip\\nThe remaining setup steps and running the software should all be done within your container shell.\\n:::\\n\\nBefore running simulations, you may need to source the environment file to ensure all dependencies load correctly:\\n\\n```sh\\nsource /opt/.bashrc\\n```\\n\\nOnce this is done, still in your container shell, navigate into the Prometheus directory:\\n\\n```sh\\ncd /home/myuser/prometheus\\n```\\n\\nAfter that, you should be able to start running simulation scripts.\\n\\n## Running Simulations\\n\\nThe [examples directory](https://github.com/Harvard-Neutrino/prometheus/tree/ana/update-readme/examples) contains example scripts for running simulations.\\n\\nAs a first-time user, you will need `example_ppc.py` for ice-based simulations and `example_olympus.py` for water-based ones. Other scripts cover more specific use case scenarios.\\n\\nTo execute a script, run:\\n\\n```sh\\npython3 python -m pip <SCRIPT_NAME>.py\\n```\\n\\nReplace `<SCRIPT_NAME>` with the name of your simulation script.\\n\\nTo learn more about how Prometheus scripts work, refer to the API documentation in the [docs directory](https://github.com/Harvard-Neutrino/prometheus/tree/main/docs/prometheus).\\n\\n## Citation\\n\\nPlease cite Prometheus using this entry:\\n\\n```bibtex\\n@article{Lazar:2023rol,\\n    author = {Lazar, Jeffrey and Meighen-Berger, Stephan and Haack, Christian and Kim, David and Giner, Santiago and Arg\\\\\\"uelles, Carlos A.},\\n    title = \\"{Prometheus: An Open-Source Neutrino Telescope Simulation}\\",\\n    eprint = \\"2304.14526\\",\\n    archivePrefix = \\"arXiv\\",\\n    primaryClass = \\"hep-ex\\",\\n    month = \\"4\\",\\n    year = \\"2023\\"\\n}\\n```\\n\\nPlease also consider citing the packages that Prometheus uses internally: LeptonInjector, PROPOSAL, PPC, and LeptonWeighter with the following citations:\\n\\n<details>\\n  <summary>LeptonInjector and LeptonWeighter</summary>\\n\\n  ```bibtex\\n  @article{IceCube:2020tcq,\\n      author = \\"Abbasi, R. and others\\",\\n      collaboration = \\"IceCube\\",\\n      title = \\"{LeptonInjector and LeptonWeighter: A neutrino event generator and weighter for neutrino observatories}\\",\\n      eprint = \\"2012.10449\\",\\n      archivePrefix = \\"arXiv\\",\\n      primaryClass = \\"physics.comp-ph\\",\\n      doi = \\"10.1016/j.cpc.2021.108018\\",\\n      journal = \\"Comput.

The actual images from the guide were also replaced with AI-generated ones.\\n\\n---\\n## \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Setup steps \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f\\n\\n:::tip\\nThe ordering of the steps is intentional, please follow it for the best results, at least when setting up from scratch.\\n:::\\n\\n### 1. Update and launch IHCOS\\n\\nMake sure you have the latest IHCOS version and no local changes:\\n\\n```\\n$ IHCOS update\\n```\\nThen run the launch command with the correct profile:\\n\\n```\\n$ IHCOS launch -p connectors-profile\\n```\\n\\nThis should start IHI, GIC, Service1 and other services you need for development. To see which exact services have been started, you can check the `path-to/service-profile.jsonnet` file in your IHCOS repo.\\n\\n### 2. Enable the necessary feature flags in IHCOS\\n\\nThese are the feature flags needed for connector development:\\n\\n- `feature_flag1_<connector_name>` - to import it with connector SDK\\n\\n- `feature_flag2_<connector_name>`- to make it visible in the UI\\n\\nFor example: for an iCollab connector, those would be `feature_flag1_icollab` and `feature_flag2_icollab`.\\n\\n### 3. Ensure your IHCOS Connector callback URI is allowed in your connector\u2019s Development Application\\n\\nThis can be found in different places depending on a service and developer portal, but should be somewhere around `Authentication > Redirect URI configuration` menu options or similar.\\n\\nHere is what it looks like for iCollab-based connectors in iCollab portal:\\n\\n![ICollab mock developer portal](./icollab-dev-portal.png)\\n\\nYour IHCOS callback URI would look something like this: `https://IHI.uri/example/callback`.\\n\\n### 4. Create an IHI integration\\n\\n:::info\\nSteps four to six are omitted from this guide example. They contained so much sensitive information that editing it out would render them meaningless. I promise, they were very nicely written out: code examples, images and everything \ud83d\ude01\\n:::\\n\\n### 7. Run Service0 in dev mode\\n\\nIf you don\'t have Service0 set up yet, here\'s a [handy setup reference](#run-service0-in-dev-mode).\\n\\nIn your terminal, in `service0` directory, run:\\n\\n```\\n$ service0 run --mode development\\n```\\n\\nThis will release your changes into your local Service1: you should see `./path/to/<your-connector>` directory appear in Service1 directory once the command runs.\\n\\n### 8. Devspace Service1\\n\\nIf you don\'t have Service1 set up yet, here\'s  a [handy setup reference](#devspace-service1).\\n\\nIn your terminal, in `service1` directory, run:\\n\\n```\\n$ devspace dev\\n```\\n\\nThis will integrate the changes that the previous step introduced.\\n\\n## \ud83d\ude31 Troubleshooting \ud83d\ude31\\n\\n### \u26a0\ufe0f I get errors when running the connect OAuth flow\\n\\nIf you get an error like this during the OAuth flow process:\\n\\n![Mock iCollab auth error](./icollab-auth-error.png)\\n\\ngo back to [Step 4](#4-create-an-ihi-integration) and ensure your IHCOS env is allowed for OAuth callback.\\n\\n### \u26a0\ufe0f I don\u2019t see my connector in the UI\\n\\nThe reason for this might be that some very fresh changes were pushed to either Service3 or Service4, and didn\'t make it to your local environment yet.\\n\\nEither of these should help:\\n\\n- Pull fresh Service3 and Service4 and devspace both. This will sync your local env with the latest version of both services.\\n\\n- Or force the connector to show by adding this line:\\n```\\n\\t<Some hacky code>\\n```\\n\\nin Service 3 `path/to/file/to-change.js` in `sampleFunction`. This is a dirty way, but it allows your local env to be more independent of whatever happens to Service3 and Service4."},{"id":"intellij-idea-setup","metadata":{"permalink":"/tw-portfolio/guides/intellij-idea-setup","source":"@site/blog/intellij-idea-setup/index.mdx","title":"IntelliJ Idea setup for Ruby development","description":"This is an informal internal guide I wrote at my former workplace on how to set up IntelliJ Idea to work with our Ruby on Rails codebase.","date":"2025-11-18T20:28:51.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"how-to","permalink":"/tw-portfolio/guides/tags/how-to"},{"inline":true,"label":"setup guide","permalink":"/tw-portfolio/guides/tags/setup-guide"},{"inline":true,"label":"developer docs","permalink":"/tw-portfolio/guides/tags/developer-docs"}],"readingTime":2.94,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[],"frontMatter":{"slug":"intellij-idea-setup","title":"IntelliJ Idea setup for Ruby development","tags":["how-to","setup guide","developer docs"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"How To Develop 3P Connectors","permalink":"/tw-portfolio/guides/how-to-develop-3p-connectors"}},"content":"This is an informal internal guide I wrote at my former workplace on how to set up IntelliJ Idea to work with our Ruby on Rails codebase. \x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n:::note[**Quick facts**]\\n**Target Audience**: Internal engineering teams.\\n\\n**My contribution**: Created this guide from scratch.\\n\\n**Challenges**: Unfamiliar software, outdated public information about the software. \\n:::\\n\\nAll sensitive information and details are edited from both images and text.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## \ud83e\udded Getting started\\n\\nIf you are completely new to IntelliJ, here are links to some docs that will help you get started:\\n\\n- [How to open/import/export a project](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/import-project-or-module-wizard.html)\\n- [How to create a CLI launcher](https://medium.com/@shaunthomas999/how-to-launch-intellij-idea-from-command-line-ba10443cc1a9)\\n- [How to install a Ruby plugin to develop with Ruby](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/ruby-plugin.html)\\n\\n## \u2699\ufe0f Project structure config\\nThis is the sample config for `<cool_codebase>` that works as of August 2025.\\n\\n### Project\\n![Project](./project.jpg)\\n\\n### Modules\\n![Modules](./modules.jpg)\\n\\n### Libraries and Artifacts\\n\\nIt\'s ok to leave both empty.\\n\\n### Facets\\n\\n![Facets](./facets.jpg)\\n\\n### SDKs\\n\\n![SDKs](./sdks.jpg)\\n\\n### Global Libraries\\n\\n![SDKs](./global-libraries.jpg)\\n\\n## \ud83d\udd34 Errors\\n\\nMost likely you will see a lot of errors, warnings and squiggly lines in your editor:\\n\\n![Errors](./errors.jpg)\\n\\nThe IntelliJ analyzer is a bit too thorough for the dynamically typed Ruby, so it\u2019s okay to silence either all of them, or everything except syntax errors.\\n\\n## \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Troubleshooting\\n\\n### \ud83d\ude31 Source root is not configured\\n\\nIn this case IntelliJ will either be yelling at you with an error, or you will not see the correct files and folders in your project (app, test, lib, etc.)\\n\\nTo fix this, you need to go to the Modules settings tab and add the content root here:\\n![Source Root Not Configured](./source-root-not-configured.jpg)\\n\\nNavigate into the `<a_codebase>` directory on your machine and click \u201cOpen\u201d.\\n\\nWhen the root is configured, you will see all the correct files and directories in your project.\\n\\n### \ud83d\ude31 Ruby Interpreter is not configured\\n\\nThis may mean that IntelliJ does not recognize your project as a Ruby project. Go to the Project Structure settings and set up all the correct modules and SDKs. Refer to the [example project structure](#\ufe0f-project-structure-config) above.\\n\\nIf you did, and IntelliJ still thinks you are programming in something else (the indicator would be that your files and folders don\u2019t have Ruby-specific icons), try:\\n- going to the Modules tab,\\n- removing any modules you see there, including the Ruby module,\\n- importing Ruby module again.\\n\\nSee [this post on the IntelliJ support forum](https://intellij-support.jetbrains.com/hc/en-us/community/posts/11908570966546/comments/12048520432658) for reference.\\n\\n### \ud83d\ude31 Can not save project structure settings\\n\\nIf you make changes to the project structure settings, and clicking \\"ok\\" or \\"apply\\" doesn\'t do anything, it\'s likely because IntelliJ is indexing the project or doing something else in the background. In the older versions of Idea you might see the progress bar at the bottom of the editor screen. In the newer versions\' UI you might see a pop-up somewhere like this one:\\n\\n![Indexing Dependencies Popup](./indexing-dependencies.jpg)\\n\\n... or you might not see anything at all, just the view that appears stuck.\\n\\nIf this is happening, here are some things to try:\\n\\n- Wait for a few minutes and then close and reopen Project Structure. When you reopen it, you may see that the settings are already applied.\\n\\n- Reset your config and start over:\\n\\t- shut down IntelliJ\\n\\t- remove the `.idea` folder from your project\\n\\t- reopen your project in IntelliJ\\n\\n\\tThis is a bit radical and counter-intuitive, but can help apply your intended settings."}]}}')}}]);
