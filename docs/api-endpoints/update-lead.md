# Update Lead by ID

A call to the Update Lead endpoint updates the [Duty](../resources-and-definitions.md#duty-object) to a particular [Team Member](../resources-and-definitions.md#team-member). To quickly rotate the duty to the next person in line, one can call the [Rotate lead to next in line](./rotate-lead-to-next.md) endpoint instead.

```bash
POST /api/lead/update
```

The API takes a body specifying the event that the lead needs to be rotated for, and the id (index in the [Roster](../resources-and-definitions.md#roster) object) of the new lead.

| Name | Required | Type | Description |
| :--- | :---: | :---: |:--- |
| event | yes | string | "standup" or "retro" |
| id | yes | number | the index of the Team Member in the Roster |

## Troubleshooting

### 400 Bad Request

This likely means that either your request URL is malformed, or the content type of the request body is incorrect.
* Check the URL and make sure it looks like: `/api/lead/update`.
* Make sure you set the `Content-Type` header to `application/json`.

Please refer to [code examples](#example-request) for request examples in select languages.

### 422 Unprocessable Entity

This may mean that your request body looks good, but the data in it is incorrect. Make sure that your request body contains a valid and [supported event type](../resources-and-definitions.md#supported-events) and a valid team member ID as a number:

```javascript
{
  "event": "standup" // or "retro"
  "id": 4
}
```

For a team member ID, refer to your team Roster. The Roster is processed as an array, so your IDs count will start with 0.
