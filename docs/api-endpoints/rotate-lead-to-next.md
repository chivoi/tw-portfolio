# Rotate lead to next in line

When the person on duty is not able to lead (for example, out sick for the week), calling the Rotate lead endpoint is a quick and handy way to move on to the next person in line.

```bash
POST /api/rotate-lead
```

This endpoint rotates the lead duty to the next [Team Member](../resources-and-definitions.md#team-member) in the [Roster](../resources-and-definitions.md#roster) by adding 1 to both current and next lead indices in the [Duty Object](../resources-and-definitions.md#duty-object), for example `{"current": 0, "next": 1}` will become: `{"current": 1, "next": 2}`.

The API takes a body specifying the [Event](../resources-and-definitions.md#events) that the lead is to be rotated for:

| Name | Required | Type | Description |
| :--- | :---: | :---: |:--- |
| event | yes | string | "standup" or "retro" |

## Troubleshooting

### 400 Bad Request

This likely means that either your request URL is malformed, or the content type of the request body is incorrect.
* Check the URL and make sure it looks like: `/api/rotate-lead`.
* Make sure you set the `Content-Type` header to `application/json`.

Please refer to [code examples](#example-request) for request examples in select languages.

### 422 Unprocessable Entity

This may mean that your request body looks good, but the data in it is incorrect. Make sure that your request body contains a valid and [supported event type](../resources-and-definitions.md#supported-events):
```javascript
{
  "event": "standup" // or "retro"
}
```
