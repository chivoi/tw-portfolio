## Troubleshooting

### 400 Bad Request

This means that your request URL might be malformed and/or incomplete. Check the URL and make sure you have specified the event you are requesting a lead for: `/api/next-lead/standup` or `/api/next-lead/retro`. Please refer to [code examples](#example-request) for request examples in select languages.
