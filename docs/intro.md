# Getting started

:::info
  This a set of docs inspired by [Roster Rosie](https://github.com/chivoi/roster-rosie), a little bot I built with a teammate for a lab day at work. It was created as a portfolio piece and written with no AI help, so there are quirks. I choose to let them be  so you get the idea of how my brain and language work without tech enhancement.
:::

> *"Who's running standup today? Any volunteers?.. [crickets]"*

> *"Anyone remember who's driving the retro today? Let's have a look at the roster... [painfully long pause]... Does anyone have a link to the roster handy? I can't seem to locate it..."*

If the beginning of every Scrum meeting in your team sounds like this, then you are in the right place. Roster Rosie is a Slack assistant bot that saves your team members time (and awkwardness!), by telling you who the scrum leader is exactly when you need it.

Here is what she can do:

- List all team members
- Report on the current / next lead for standup or retrospective
- Rotate the current lead of the event to the next person on the roster
- Inform your team about who is on duty via Slack message

If you would like to experiment, here is a [Postman collection](https://www.postman.com/chivoi/roster-rosie/collection/9m5cl9c/roster-rosie-request-examples?action=share&creator=14131077) with sample requests for all available endpoints.
