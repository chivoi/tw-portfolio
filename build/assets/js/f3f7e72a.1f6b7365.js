The actual images from the guide were also replaced with AI-generated ones. \\n\\nI hope that despite all of the above, this guide sample is descriptive-enough as a portfolio piece \ud83d\ude05\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n---\\n\\n## \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Setup steps \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f\\n\\n:::tip\\nThe ordering of the steps is intentional, please follow it for the best results, at least when setting up from scratch.\\n:::\\n\\n### 1. Update and launch IHCOS\\n\\nMake sure you have the latest IHCOS version and no local changes:\\n\\n```\\n$ IHCOS update\\n```\\nThen run the launch command with the correct profile:\\n\\n```\\n$ IHCOS launch -p connectors-profile\\n```\\n\\nThis should starts IHI, GIC, Service1 and other services you need for development. To see which exact services have been started, you can check `path-to/service-profile.jsonnet` file in your IHCOS repo.\\n\\n### 2. Enable the necessary feature flags in IHCOS\\n\\nThese are the feature flags needed for connector development:\\n\\n- `feature_flag1_<connector_name>` - to import it with connector SDK\\n\\n- `feature_flag2_<connector_name>`- to make it visible in the UI\\n\\nFor example: for an iCollab connector those would be `feature_flag1_icollab` and `feature_flag2_icollab`.\\n\\n### 3. Ensure your IHCOS Connector callback URI is allowed in your connector\u2019s Development Application\\n\\nThis can be found in different places depending on a service and developer portal, but should be somewhere around `Authentication > Redirect URI configuration` menu options or similar.\\n\\nHere is what it looks like for iCollab-based connectors in iCollab portal:\\n\\n![ICollab mock developer portal](./icollab-dev-portal.png)\\n\\nYour IHCOS callback URI would look something like this: `https://IHI.uri/example/callback`.\\n\\n### 4. Create an IHI integration\\n\\n:::info\\nSteps four to six are ommitted from this guide example. They contained so much sensitive information that editing it out would render them meaningless. I promise, they were very nicely written out: code examples, images and everything \ud83d\ude01\\n:::\\n\\n### 7. Run Service0 in dev mode\\n\\nIf you don\'t have Service0 set up yet, here is a [handy setup reference](#run-service0-in-dev-mode).\\n\\nIn your terminal, in `service0` directory, run:\\n\\n```\\n$ service0 run --mode development\\n```\\n\\nThis will release your changes into your local Service1: you should see `./path/to/<your-connector>` directory appear in Service1 directory once the command runs.\\n\\n### 8. Devspace Service1\\n\\nIf you don\'t have Service1 set up yet, here is a [handy setup reference](#devspace-service1).\\n\\nIn your terminal, in `service1` directory, run:\\n\\n```\\n$ devspace dev\\n```\\n\\nThis will integrate the changes that the previous step introduced.\\n\\n## \ud83d\ude31 Troubleshooting \ud83d\ude31\\n\\n### \u26a0\ufe0f I get errors when running the connect OAuth flow\\n\\nIf you get an error like this during the OAuth flow process:\\n\\n![Mock iCollab auth error](./icollab-auth-error.png)\\n\\ngo back to [Step 4](#4-create-an-ihi-integration) and ensure your IHCOS env is allowed for OAuth callback.\\n\\n### \u26a0\ufe0f I don\u2019t see my connector in the UI\\n\\nThe reason for this might be that some very fresh changes were pushed to either Service3 or Service4, and didn\'t make it to your local environmet yet.\\n\\nEither should help:\\n\\n- Pull fresh Service3 and Service4 and devspace both. This will sync your local env with the latest version of both services.\\n\\n- Or force the connector to show by adding this line:\\n```\\n\\t<Some hacky code>\\n```\\n\\nin Service 3 `path/to/file/to-change.js` in `sampleFunction`. This is a dirty way, but it allows your local env to be more independent of whatever happens to Service3 and Service4."},{"id":"intellij-idea-setup","metadata":{"permalink":"/guides/intellij-idea-setup","source":"@site/blog/intellij-idea-setup/index.mdx","title":"IntelliJ Idea setup for Ruby development","description":"This is an internal guide I wrote at my former workplace for developers or any other IDE users on how to set up IntelliJ Idea to work with our Ruby on Rails codebase.

Go to the Project Structure settings and set up all the correct modules and SDKs. Refer to the [example project structure](#\ufe0f-project-structure-config) above.\\n\\nIf you did, and IntelliJ still thinks you are programming in something else (the indicator of this would be that your files and folders don\u2019t have Ruby-specific icons), try this:\\n- go to Modules tab,\\n- remove any modules you see therem, including the Ruby module,\\n- import Ruby module again.\\n\\nSee [this post on the IntelliJ support forum](https://intellij-support.jetbrains.com/hc/en-us/community/posts/11908570966546/comments/12048520432658) for reference.\\n\\n### \ud83d\ude31 Can not save project structure settings\\n\\nThis is the case when you have made changes to the project structure settings, and then trying to click \u201cok\u201d or \u201capply\u201d, but nothing is happening, and there are no visible errors.\\n\\nThe reason for this is likely that IntelliJ is indexing the project or working something else in the background. In the older versions of Idea you might see the progress bar at the bottom of the editor screen. In newer versions UI you might see a pop up somewhere like this one:\\n\\n![Indexing Dependencies Popup](./indexing-dependencies.jpg)\\n\\n... or you might not see anything at all.\\n\\nThe solution might be to either:\\n\\n- Wait for a few minutes and then close and reopen Project Structure. When you reopen it, you may see that the settings are already applied.\\n\\n- If the above doesn\u2019t help, try the radical way of removing your config and starting again:\\n\\t- shut down IntelliJ\\n\\t- remove the `.idea` folder from your project \\n\\t- reopen your project in IntelliJ\\n\\n\\tIn this case you might see that your settings are magically fixed."}]}}')}}]);
